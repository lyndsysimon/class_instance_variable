# class_instance_variable

A simple implementation of class instance variables, mostly because I can never remember the specific syntax necessary to create them, and because having several lines of code to do something so simple and commonly-used annoyed me.

## IMPORTANT

This gem is very much incomplete - please don't use it until this notice is removed :)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
